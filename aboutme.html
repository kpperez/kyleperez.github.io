						<h3>About Me</h3> 
						<p>From a young age, I was exposed to the worlds of entrepreneurship and science through my parents. During high school, I gained valuable experience working in my mother's hospitality business, where I learned the significance of operational efficiency and effectiveness. Simultaneously, my father instilled in me critical thinking and problem-solving skills through various building and repair projects.</p>
						<p>As I approached the end of high school, I took on the role of assistant general manager for my mother's business, leading a team of over 10 individuals. Building on this management experience, I decided to relocate to Boulder, Colorado, where I embarked on my data journey as the operations manager at JAR Inc. In this position, I successfully oversaw a staff of 30-45 members, met financial targets, and discovered my underlying passion for data analysis and programming. I developed interactive Excel dashboards for fellow managers, aiding in the tracking and adjustment of various metrics.</p>
						<p>Motivated by my accumulated management expertise, I pursued a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from Colorado Mesa University, specializing in Business Analytics and Management. I achieved Summa Cum Laude honors, graduating with a perfect 4.0 GPA. Throughout my higher education, I engaged in quantitative and software-focused courses, including big data analytics with Python, data mining and visualizations using Tableau, problem-solving with databases using SQL, and econometrics utilizing R. Additionally, I continuously expand my skill set by independently learning programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/daff_me.jpg" alt="" /></span><strong>Outside of work</strong>, I find joy in training my working Spaniel, Daffy, in the field. Activities like hunting, fishing, snowboarding and hiking are among our favorite pastimes. Collaborating with my father, I also indulge in working on classic and modern sports cars. I firmly believe that learning is a lifelong pursuit, whether it involves acquiring new skills or embracing philosophical lessons. Each day presents an opportunity to broaden my knowledge and understanding.</p>
